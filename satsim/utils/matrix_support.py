    Create a skew-symmetric matrix from a 3D vector for cross-product representation.

    This function constructs a 3x3 skew-symmetric matrix from a given 3D vector,

    For a vector v = [v1, v2, v3], the skew-symmetric matrix is:

def to_rotation_matrix(vec: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:

    Converts a 3D vector to a 3x3 rotation matrix using optimized PyTorch operations.

    This function computes a 3x3 rotation matrix from a 3D vector based on a specific
    mathematical formulation involving the vector's squared norm, cross terms, and
    normalization. The resulting matrix is derived from the vector's components (x, y, z)

    Args:
        vec (torch.Tensor): Input tensor of shape [3] representing a 3D vector (x, y, z).

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Output tensor of shape [3, 3] representing the rotation matrix.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input tensor does not have shape [3].

    Notes:
        The computation follows the formula from the original C++ implementation:
        - Diagonal terms: 4 * (x^2 - y^2 - z^2) + (1 - ||v||^2)^2, etc.
        - Off-diagonal terms: 8xy Â± 4z(1 - ||v||^2), etc.
        - Normalization: Divide by (1 + ||v||^2)^2.
        The implementation uses vectorized operations for efficiency and supports
        GPU acceleration by inheriting the input tensor's dtype and device.
